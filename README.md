# FilteredMap
A map that can be filtered using buttons which are generated based on attributes of map entries

The map is based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) using the [Leaflet mapping library](https://leafletjs.com/) and [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) tiles and was built as part of a university project for a Technical English course.
